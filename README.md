🧠 Brain Tumor Detection using CNN and Flask
This project is a deep learning-based web application that detects brain tumors from MRI images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It classifies images into one of four categories: glioma tumor, meningioma tumor, pituitary tumor, or no tumor. A Flask web interface allows users to upload MRI scans and receive predictions instantly.

Dataset:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri

## 📌 Features
Built a CNN model using TensorFlow and Keras to classify MRI images.

Trained on a labeled dataset containing four categories of brain scans.

Interactive web interface using Flask to upload images and view predictions.

Dynamic result display with tumor type and confidence score.

Visualization of training progress (accuracy, loss, confusion matrix).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
Python, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Flask - web server and routing

HTML/CSS - user interface
